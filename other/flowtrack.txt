DCF(discriminative correlation filters)

Then the previous frames are warped to specified frame by the guiding of flow information, and they are aggregated for consequent 
correlation filter tracking. For adaptive aggregation, a novel spatial-temporal attention mechanism is developed.

All these trackers only consider appearance features in current frame and can hardly benefit from motion and inter-frame information.
In this paper, we make full use of these information by aggregating flow and Siamese tracking in an end-to-end framework.
