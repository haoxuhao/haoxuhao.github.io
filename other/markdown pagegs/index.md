## Crowd estimation (10/2018-1/2019)
**Synopsis**: To improve the mainstream density-regression-based crowd estimation algorithm, we proposed a new learning branch to explicitly tackle the false response on the environment.

**Main work**：

* A new crowd estimation framework based on foreground learning was proposed to tackle the false response on the complex environment.
* A new and simple method was proposed to generate the foreground segmentation map from head-point annotations which was used for foreground learning.   

**Results**：

* Both the visualization results and the accuracy are better than the baseline method CSRNet.
* Paper: Hao Xu, Siyu Xia, et al. Crowd Counting with Segmentation Map Guidance, IEEE 2019 38th Chinese Control Conference (CCC).

## Coal-gangue sorting system (11/2018-4/2019)
**Synopsis**: The image processing method is used to identify the coal mine on the conveyor belt. The gangue is localized based on the color image, and the coordinates on the conveyor belt are sent to the robot. The robot grabs the gangue from the conveyor belt.

**Main work**：

* Use yolo detection algorithm to detect the coal and gangue: high performance and high precision. 

* Implement a windows app with GUI for practical application: Algorithm migration, camera module, communication with the robot.

**Results**: Completed a windows app with an algorithm accuracy of about 90%.

## Face recognition in surveillance video (1/2018-5/2018)
**Synopsis**: Reproduce the video face recognition algorithm (NAN Neural Aggregation Network) and apply it to face recognition in real surveillance scenes.

**Main work**：

* The NAN module is added to facenet to realize video face recognition, and the accuracy of the algorithm (96.4%) is verified on the dataset YoutubeFace, which achieves the result of the paper.
* The algorithm is applied to the real monitoring scene, and the face passing by the scene is captured and recognized in real time:
    
**Results**：The NAN algorithm was reproduced, and the online face recognition software in the real monitoring scene was completed, and the accuracy rate reached 82%.
