Hi I am *Hao Xu*,  I am currently a softerware engineer at Pinduoduo, China mainly working on GPU-related performance engineering for recommendation models. Before that, I obtained the bachelor and master's degrees from department of automation, Southeast University, Nanjing China, where I did some researche on evolutionary multitasking and computer vision. Here's the [CV](other/files/resume_haoxu.pdf).



## Publications

- **Evolutionary Multitasking**: H. Xu, A. K. Qin and S. Xia, "Evolutionary Multi-task Optimization with Adaptive Knowledge Transfer," IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, doi: 10.1109/TEVC.2021.3107435.

## Work

- Software Engineer at **Pinduoduo** (07.2021 - present):  GPU-related performance engineering for recommendation models.

  

- Software Intern at **Ant Group **(06.2020 - 08.2020): multi-objective optimization. 

   

- Research Intern at **Swinburne University of Technology** (09.2019 - 12.2019, Melbourne): evolutionary multi-task optimization.

  

## Personal projects

- **Competition on vehicle detection in aerial  images**:  A complex one-stage objection detector Retinanet-Resnext101 (backend by [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection)) is employed with some strategies (multi-scale training, balanced sampling, etc.) to improve the accuracy and achieved 2/132. Here's the [report](other/files/aerial-vehicle-detection.pdf).

  

- **Imaged based coal-gangue recognition**: A fast YOLOv2 detector is used to detect the coal mine on the conveyor belt and a robotic arm is used to grabs the gangue from the conveyor belt. Here's a [demo](images/portfolio/coal-gan/demo.gif).
