## Intro

Hi, I am **Hao Xu**. A master student studies at Southeast University, Nanjing China. Interested in Machine Learning, Evolutionary Optimization, and Parallel Computing. Deeply fascinated by the charm of computing. Happy to see you. 

- The chinise resume can be found [here](other/resume/resume-wondercv.pdf).

## Projects

- **Evolutionary Multitasking on GPU cluster**: Paper is under review.
- **Crowd estimation**: To improve the mainstream density-regression-based crowd estimation algorithm, a new learning branch is integrated into CSRNet to explicitly tackle the false response on the complex background. The background false response is effectively suppressed and a better accuracy to CSRNet is achieved. See the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8865761/) for details.
- **Aerial vehicle detection competition**:  In this competition,  a very complex one-stage detector Retinanet-Resnext101 (backend by [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection)) is first utilized and several commonly used tricks are included to guarantee the performance. Finally, after several weeks of hard work, I won the second place out of 132 teams and the 5, 000rmb bonus. See the final [report](other/files/aerial-vehicle-detection.pdf) for details.
- **Coal-gangue sorting system**: Automatically select the gangue from the raw coal mine on the conveyor belt. The YOLO detector is used to detect the coal mine on the conveyor belt. The gangue is detected and the coordinates on the conveyor belt are transformed and sent to the robot. The robot grabs the gangue from the conveyor belt. See the [demo](images/portfolio/coal-gan/demo.gif) for details.

## Internship

- Nanjing Fujitsu Nanda Software Technology Co. Ltd.

  Participate in the development of distributed unified storage software [DUS](https://www.fujitsu.com/cn/group/fnst/solution/#title3) (Distributed Unified Storage), this project is based on [glusterfs](https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs).  During the 3-months internship, I first dived into the source code of glusterfs and completed a file decryption tool which is used to read out the encrypted files when the storage system is down. And last developed and improved the file deduplication feature in DUS.
